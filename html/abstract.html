<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p style="font-size:15px;"><em>Background and aim:</em> Although the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging manual is the golden standard for melanoma staging, discrepancies regarding outcomes between stages persist. Consequently, an increase of stage does not necessarily correspond to higher risk for recurrence or melanoma-specific mortality (MSM). Identifying patient-individual outcomes rather than grouping patients according to outcome is crucial as for some patients risk of toxicity may outweigh the absolute benefit from treatment. To overcome these staging discrepancies, our aim was to develop a model predicting recurrence and MSM in patients with >T1a melanoma on a continuous scale.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;"><em>Methods:</em> A total of 4071 patients were selected. All patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy between 1997 and 2003 in one of four European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer melanoma centers. Prognostic factors for recurrence and MSM were identified using a cox proportional hazards model. Significant factors were included in the model. Model performance was assessed by discrimination (cC-index) and calibration across the four centers. The model was incorporated into a nomogram for graphical representation.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;"><em>Results:</em> The final model for recurrence and MSM contained six prognostic factors: Positive sentinel node (SN)-status, Breslow depth, ulceration, age, location and SN tumor burden. The Cc-index for the recurrence model was 0.76 and was equal to the MSM model. Cross-validation using the leave-one-center out method showed reasonable model performance. Using the prognostic variables, a nomogram was developed. </p>

<p style="font-size:15px;"><em>Conclusion:</em> Considering the advances in the management of patients with melanoma eligible for adjuvant treatment, an accurate model and nomogram were developed to provide patient-specific risk probabilities for recurrence and MSM. The nomogram aids in clinical decision-making.</p>
